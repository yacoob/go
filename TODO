# Eternal TODO list:

* address all FIXMEs in the code;
* top margin for first H1 element seems to be... gone;
* more testing for trampolina part;
* solve the horrible race condition :)
* s/getopt/optparse/;
* sanitization & validation of url parameters;
* better templates;
* cx_freeze action;
* (if I'm bored and have too much hair on my head) unittests? :)
