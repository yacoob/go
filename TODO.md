# Eternal TODO list:

* address all FIXMEs in the code;
* more testing for trampolina part;
* solve the horrible race condition :)
* s/getopt/optparse/;
* sanitization & validation of url parameters;
* cx_freeze action;
* perhaps a form for /hop/push?
* (if I'm bored and have too much hair on my head) unittests? :)
