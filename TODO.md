# Eternal TODO list:

* chrome extension: pop all
* chrome extension: warn if url has already been seen
* server side: fetch HEAD, show title instead of url?
* mobile version of the site
* address all FIXMEs in the code;
* sanitization & validation of url parameters;
* perhaps a form for /hop/push?
